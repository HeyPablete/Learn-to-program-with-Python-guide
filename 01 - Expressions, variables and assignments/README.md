# Expressions, variables and assignments
Comments, strings, numbers, arithmetic operators, arithmetic expressions, variables.

Comments
-------
Non-computational parts of the program that textually describe the behavior of the program.
Comments begin with #, everything to right of the hash is ignored by Python.
Comments should be frequent so you and others can understand the code.

Strings
-------
Sequence of characters enclosed by a pair of single or double quotes
Examples are "cats hate dogs" and 'Strings are fun!'.
Strings are one kind of data in Python. Their data type is denoted str.

Numbers — Arithmetic Expressions
-------
There are two kinds of numerical data in Python: integers and decimal numbers.
Integers correspond to the data type int. Decimal numbers are represented by floating-point numbers corresponding to the data type float.
Floating-point numbers have around 15 decimal digits of accuracy.

Arithmetic Operators — Arithmetic Expressions
-------
Five basic arithmetic operators; addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), division (/) and exponentiation (**)
In Python 2, the division operator (/) returns a float approximation to the exact answer if either of the operands is a  float.  If both operands are integers, division returns the exact answer round down to the nearest integer.
The integer division operator // returns the quotient of two numbers..

Arithmetic Expressions — Arithmetic Expressions
-------
An arithmetic expression is either a number or an operator applied to two arithmetic expressions.
Arithmetic expressions are entered as a sequence of numbers and arithmetic operators.
Expressions are formed by grouping operators and operands via precedence: "Please excuse my dear Aunt Sallie"; parentheses, exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction.

Variables — Variables
-------
Variable names consist of a sequence of letters, number and underscores (_).
Variable names start with a letter or underscore and are case sensitive.
Single equals (=) is used for assignment to variables. Double equals (==) is used for testing equality.
