#--------------------Type Errors -------------------#

################### Example 1 ########################
#TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects
#Cause: trying to do operations on two things that 
#don't allow it

my_string = "Hello!"
my_number = 5

my_string + my_number

#It doesn't make sense to try and add an integer to 
#a string, so this error pops up. To fix it, make sure that
#everything in the equation can be used with your operator 
#of choice
