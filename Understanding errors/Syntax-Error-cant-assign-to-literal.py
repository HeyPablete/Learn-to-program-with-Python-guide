#--------------------Syntax Errors -----------------#

################### Example 4  #######################
#Syntax Error: can't assign to literal
#Cause: variable on the right side of assignment statement

10 = x

#To fix this one, just flip it around: 

#x = 10

#When you're putting a value (10) into a variable (x), 
#the variable has to be on the left, and the value has
#to be on the right. That's one of the syntax rules
#that Python obeys, just like English has a rule that 
#says adjectives come before the noun, not after.
