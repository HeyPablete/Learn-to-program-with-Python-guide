#--------------------Syntax Errors -----------------#

################### Example 3a #######################
#Syntax Error: bad input ('print')
#Cause: bad indentation

def say_hello():
print "Hello world!"

#Python expects a tab character to appear after a colon. 
#Instead, it saw the "print" keyword, so it threw an error.
#Add a tab in front of "print" to remove the error.

#Spacing is very important in Python! This can be tough
#for newbies and experienced coders alike. If you're coming
#from a language like Java, where brackets are king, using
#whitespace as part of the syntax is difficult to get used 
#to. For newbies, learning to pay attention to the whitespace,
#which your eyes normally just skim over, is similarly
#difficult. 

#Moral: Whitespace (spaces, tabs, and blank lines) matters!
