#--------------------Syntax Errors -----------------#

################### Example 1 #######################   
#SyntaxError: bad input ('  
#')
#Cause: Forgetting punctuation

def say_hello()
    print "Hello world!"
    
#This is a very common error. Python requires a colon at the
#end of function definitions. Add it into the function above
#after "say_hello()" and the error will go away.

#You might find that your error doesn't say exactly this.
#The "bad input" is whatever text follows the missing
#punctuation. If you have a bad input error, no matter
#what it says in the parentheses, you should check your
#punctuation.
